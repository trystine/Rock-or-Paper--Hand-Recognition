# Rock-or-Paper--Hand-Recognition

This project uses Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset from Kaggle and trains the dataset using Xception Model to recognize paper or rock sign. The project will explain how to use kaggle dataset API and export the same on Google Colab.

Also this Model works on Real time Webcam capture using Google colab snippet.

## Contents:

### 1) Setting Up Kaggle so that we can import the Rock, Paper and Scissors datasets through API 
### 2) Deleting the scissors label dataset from the imported data 
### 3) Encoding Labels with LabelBinarizer
### 4) Data Augmentation and Loading Xception Model
### 5) Training
### 6) Try on your on, using real time webcam through Google Colab and feed the input to the Model
